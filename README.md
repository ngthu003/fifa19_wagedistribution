Fifa 2019: Exploratory analysis on wage distributions

**Learning objectives:**
1.  Cleaning up data;
2.  Exploring data through plots;
3.  Conducting hypothesis tests between 2 populations.

The dataset used is fifa19 from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/karangadiya/fifa19.

The project has 4 sections:
1.  *Clean up data*: clean up a variety of data types, some of which are to be used for later analysis, others are cleaned up as practice;
2.  *Plots*: exploratory plots for learning about the relationships between wages and a variety of variables: positions, leagues;
3.  *Distributions of Wage, Overall, and Potential*: analysis and hypothesis tests of the wage distributions among the top 5 leagues in Europe;
4.  *Difference between top 1% and the rest*: further analysis and hypothesis tests of wage distributions based on the players ratings.
